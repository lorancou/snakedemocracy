  TODO list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Client:
 - Show victory condition for 5 seconds after 5 apples + tail tip blinks
 - Fix incorrect score when coming back on victory state after idling
 - event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit.
  [ They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
 - Weird socket.io retrieving issue:
    * Firefox: "NetworkError: 400 Invalid header received from client
    [ http://snakedemocracy.herokuapp.com/socket.io/1/websocket/XXX"
    -> if fixed, call serverDown on socket error
    -> seem allright with Iceweasel... maybe this is only server overload
 - Fix for paranoid security software: this: http://housecall.trendmicro.com/
 - Idle after beeing spectator for too long
 - Wait for backping before updating, just skipping one frame for now
    -> cf. early return in update()
 
Server
 - Kick cheaters?
 - Bots if too few players?
 - Find a better way to include vec2.js / common.js etc.
 
Common
 - Better vec2, ready for socket transport
 - Compress those messages, use as less strings and params as possible
