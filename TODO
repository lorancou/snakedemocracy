  TODO list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Client:
 - Hide score on defeat
 - Detect server restart / DOS / sepuku
 - Weird socket.io retrieving issue:
    * Chrome: Unexpected response code: 503
    * Firefox: "NetworkError: 400 Invalid header received from client
    [ http://snakedemocracy.herokuapp.com/socket.io/1/websocket/XXX"
 - Fix for paranoïd security software: this: http://housecall.trendmicro.com/
 - (Blink or shine or something to indicate when victory is close)
 - Fix pingback sometimes glitching (missing snake body parts?)
 - Wait for backping before updating, just skipping one frame for now
    -> cf. early return in update()
 
Website
 - Display victory condition after 5 apples eaten + tip tail blinks and shine
 - Victory tweet
 - Side/promote/apple tweet
 - About page
 - Cross with EWSN instead of leftist, rightists, forwardists?
 
Server
 - Kick cheaters?
 - Bots if too few players?
 - Find this f*cking memleaks:
    -> https://github.com/felixge/node-memory-leak-tutorial
 - Sepuku every turn?
 - Find a better way to include vec2.js / common.js etc.
 
Common
 - better vec2, ready for socket transport
 - compress those messages
