---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Client:
 - Weird socket.io retrieving issue:
    * Firefox: "NetworkError: 400 Invalid header received from client
    [ http://snakedemocracy.herokuapp.com/socket.io/1/websocket/XXX"
    -> if fixed, call serverDown on socket error
 - *NO* connection with Firefox w/o Firebug!! (console. ?)
 - Fix for paranoid security software: this: http://housecall.trendmicro.com/
 - Show victory condition for 5 seconds after 5 apples + tail tip blinks
 - Idle after beeing spectator for too long
 - Wait for backping before updating, just skipping one frame for now
    -> cf. early return in update()
 - Fix incorrect score when coming back on victory state after idling
 - event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit.
  [ They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
 
Server
 - Kick cheaters?
 - Bots if too few players?
 - Find this f*cking memleaks:
    -> https://github.com/felixge/node-memory-leak-tutorial
    -> if there's nothing... seppuku every turn?
 - Find a better way to include vec2.js / common.js etc.
 
Common
 - Better vec2, ready for socket transport
 - Compress those messages, use as less strings and params as possible
 
Website
 - Display victory condition after 5 apples eaten + tip tail blinks and shine
 - About page

Publishing

  * cf. http://developers.pokki.com/docs/review.php
  * HTML layout (< 710x910 px)
  * Remove victory tweet?
  * Idle when minimized (cf. Idle detect)
  * Badges... new player? New game started? new apple?
  * Hower state on directional arrows + change mouse pointer
  * Limit user select (user-select:none)
