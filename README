  LEFT. RIGHT. VOTE.

“We won’t tolerate the dictatorship of one snake player anymore”
(Abraham Lincoln)

You like the good old game of "snake"? Turning left and right, growing, staying
alive the longest you can?

But how would you feel about sharing the control... WITH THE PEOPLE?

In the web-game SNAKE DEMOCRACY, an unlimited number of players can join the
ride and VOTE to decide where the snake should go next, knowing that a new move
occurs automatically every 4 seconds, forward by default. Better yet, we provide
a Twitter feed so you may call your friends upon this FUNDAMENTAL CIVIC DUTY
(Unless you're a totalitarist dictator and want to play on your own, of
course)... Also, every #snakedemocracy tweets bring MORE APPLES on the field!

And beware, to make a highscore, you must have the longest snake AND CONFIRM
your score by biting your own tail... So chose wisely when this should happen,
because the longer you will be, the harder it will be to stay alive!

(Almost democratic tip: every player can vote as much as he wants during the 4
seconds "election of the next move", by mashing a directional key... So an
especially *convinced* voter may very well tip the balance in favor of his
party)
